In the next few weeks, my team, Adekoya Adepeju, Niguse Kelile Lema, and I will be delving deeper into the CLASSIFICATION OF CLINICAL STAGES OF LIVER CANCER USING MACHINE LEARNING at the HackBio Bioinformatics for Cancer Research.

This is our project outline that we aim to develop into a publishable manuscript. Feel free to follow us along this incredibly insightful journey.
